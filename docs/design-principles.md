# Design Principles

## Neurodivergent‑First
- Reduce visual density; prioritize spacing and clear hierarchy
- Keep on‑screen items ≤6 when possible; favor progressive disclosure
- Provide immediate feedback loops; avoid ambiguous states

## Interaction Patterns
- Zen Mode for focus; dim non‑essential elements
- Consistent keyboard navigation; predictable tab order
- Meaningful, short copy; explain “why,” not just “what”

## Documentation Components
- Quick Tasks sidebar: collapsible, remembers preference, keyboard accessible
- Diagrams: include title/desc; highlight on hover/focus; concise legends
- Tooltips: use SVG <title> for hover/focus hints; no JS required

## Error Handling
- Gentle, actionable messages; offer remediation paths
- Treat errors as teachable moments with quick fixes
